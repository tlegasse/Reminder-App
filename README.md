# Reminder-App
This is a really simple reminder app.
* It uses redbean to manage all database interactions.
* It uses PHPMailer to manage email sending.
* It uses your *immagination* to use it to its **fullest** extent (eh, it's just a weekend project).

## Installation
```
composer install
```
SQL and an example config file are included in the config directory.
After that you'll also need a minutely cron running. Just point it to https://{URL}/heartbeat

Unit tests to follow
